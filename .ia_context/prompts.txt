Claude, please load and remember the project context for **Katana Studio**.

The context is located in the `.ia_context/` folder at the root of the repository.
It contains all the architecture notes, factories, and design decisions.

Please read and index all files under:
- `.ia_context/_OVERVIEW.md`
- `.ia_context/_TECH_REFERENCE/**/*`
- `.ia_context/_CONTEXT/**/*`
- `.ia_context/manifest.json`
- `.ia_context/manifest.schema.json`

When done, confirm that you’ve loaded the full context and summarize the key concepts you’ve understood.

After loading, you should always use this context when answering any question or generating code for Katana Studio.
This includes:
- understanding the git-like state pattern (stash/commit),
- how hooks, adapters, and stores are structured,
- how form fields and datasets are implemented,
- and all architectural conventions described inside `.ia_context/`.

If I later say “reindex context”, please re-read the `.ia_context/` folder to include any updated files.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Claude, please **reindex the project context**.

Re-read all files under `.ia_context/` (including subfolders) and update your understanding of the Katana Studio architecture.

You should reload:
- `_OVERVIEW.md`
- `_TECH_REFERENCE/**/*`
- `_CONTEXT/**/*`
- `manifest.json` and `manifest.schema.json`

After reindexing, confirm that the context has been refreshed successfully and summarize only what has changed since the last load.
